						# Guqin Tablature Composer

						<!-- <a href="/nltabs/2MILMah"><img src="/screenshot.jpg" class="img-fluid" /></a> -->

						## Brief Intro to NL Tabs
						Create Guqin music with the NLTabs (Numeric Linear Tablature) system. This creates Guqin music with a simple entry method. Guqin Notation traditionally has been a bit tricky to read. It's efficient in that it compresses a bunch of playing instructions into characters. However, it has a rather steep learning curve, and more importantly I could not find a way to write scores in the traditional notation on a computer. I don't really own paper anymore, so..... I created my own system for writing Guqin music! 

						NLTabs basically converts the finger positions into a more visual schema, using lines to represent lines (crazy!) of the Guqin, and numbers to represent which position along the line to press or touch. The text above the 7 line tabs represent what you do with your right hand and which finger to use, and the text below represent what you do with your left. 

						Here's a comparison between traditional format and NL Tabs.

						## Composing and Rendering Scores

						To make it easier for me to write music, I also developed a shorthand which converts into the tablature format you see above. A "减字谱" (jianzipu) if you will, or 减字Tabs. 

						The shorthand is broken into `n:` lines (notes) and `f:` lines (finger positions). The note lines follows your basic LilyPond flavor notation, where notes are represeted by `a`-`g` (FanYin represented by capitalized `A`-`G`). Rhythms are represented by numbers (`4` is a quarter note, `2` is a half note). So `c4` is a bass c quarter note. 

						The finger lines has three main parts. (1) The number `1`-`7` represents which string to use. (2) Left hand positions are represented by `s` (4th finger/ring), `d` (3rd finger/middle), `f` (2nd finger/index), `v` (1st finger/thumb). Because this is where they rest on the US keyboard. (3) Right hand positions, similarly based on where fingers rest on the keyboard follows as such: `n` (thumb plucking inward), `j` (index plucking inward), `k` (middle plucking inward), `h` (thumb plucking outward), etc. There are also options for characters like `~` to represent vibratos; `/` and `\` to represent sliding in and out of a note.

						Here's a quick example:
